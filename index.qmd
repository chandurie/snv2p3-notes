  Here we try to reproduce the analysis of SNV2.2 and SNV2.3 as done by Shreya from her codes and data. Learn about [Mittheilungen Data](./mittheilungen_data.qmd) and [Source Book Data](./source_book_data.qmd). And additinal data added by Shreya are explored. Note that unless sepcified, the data used here are from Shreya's data. 

We try to apply the same modifications to Mittheilungen data as done in Shreya's codes, and add the data from source mentioned in the article \[@city-key]. And try to make a [All Combined Data](./all_combined_data.qmd) set that includes all data sources and changes to Mittheilungen.
